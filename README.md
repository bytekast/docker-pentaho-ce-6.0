[![Deploy to Tutum](https://s.tutum.co/deploy-to-tutum.svg)](https://dashboard.tutum.co/stack/deploy/)

## Base image for running Pentaho BA Server CE software within a Docker Container

### Building
```
docker build -t bytekast/pentaho-ce-6.0 .
```

### Running

`bytekast/pentaho-ce-6.0` is designed to run as a daemon, which you can ssh into and intall Pentaho.

To start a new container, run
```
docker run -d -p 2222:22 -p 8888:8080 -e AUTHORIZED_KEYS="`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`" bytekast/pentaho-ce-6.0
```

You are now able to ssh directly into the container with your ssh keys (Replace DOCKER_HOST with the `boot2docker` ip address or the docker host ip)
```
ssh -p 2222 root@DOCKER_HOST
```

To check the biserver logs, ssh to the container and run:
```
tail -f /home/pentaho/biserver-ce-6.0.0.0-353/biserver-ce/tomcat/logs/catalina.out
```

Or run in the docker host:
```
docker logs $CONTAINER_ID
```

When the server is running (check the logs), go to: http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP}:8888/pentaho
